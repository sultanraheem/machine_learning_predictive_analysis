#### Statistical Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and mode are calculated for various sales columns. For instance, the mean global sales across all games, the median sales for specific platforms, and the standard deviation of sales across different genres are considered.

- **Range of Global Sales**: The global sales of video games have a wide range, from the minimum to a maximum value of 82.73 million units. This indicates significant variability in the success of video games, with a few titles achieving exceptional sales while most games have modest figures.

- **Variance and Standard Deviation of Global Sales**: The variance of 2.45 and standard deviation of 1.57 indicate that while there is variability in sales, most games cluster around the mean, with a few outliers driving the high range.

- **Interquartile Range (IQR) of Global Sales**: The IQR of 0.42 suggests that the middle 50% of games have global sales that are relatively close in value, highlighting that extreme sales figures are outliers.

The key statistical indicators are supported by visualizations and/or tables.

#### Findings

- **Genre Popularity**: The Sports genre dominates global sales, largely driven by titles like Wii Sports. Role-Playing and Platform games also perform strongly, particularly in Japan.

- **Platform Evolution**: The analysis shows the rise and fall of different gaming platforms over time, with platforms like the Wii, NES, and PlayStation series showing significant peaks in their respective eras.

- **Regional Preferences**: The data highlights the variation in gaming preferences across different regions. For example, Japan shows a stronger preference for Role-Playing games, while North America favors Action and Sports games.

- **Range of Global Sales**: The wide range of global sales, with a maximum of 82.73 million units, highlights the stark differences in success among video games. A small number of titles achieve extraordinarily high sales, while most games remain well below this peak.

- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: The variance (2.45) and standard deviation (1.57) further illustrate the spread of sales data, with most games clustering around a central value but with notable outliers that skew the distribution.

## Modelling

The `modelling.ipynb` notebook provides an in-depth analysis of video game sales data, utilizing various datasets stored in a SQLite database. The analysis involves data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of several machine learning models to predict global video game sales. Despite the effort, the predictive models did not perform as expected, with evaluation metrics such as RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicating room for improvement.

### Features

#### 1. Data Loading
- **Source**: Data is loaded from an SQLite database (`games_data.sqlite`), which includes three primary datasets:
  - **Video Game Sales Data** (`data` table): Contains information about video game sales across different regions.
  - **GDP Data** (`gdp` table): GDP information over various years.
  - **Population Data** (`population` table): Population statistics across different years.
  
#### 2. Data Inspection
- **Initial Inspection**: The script begins by displaying the first few rows of each dataset, allowing for an overview of the data structure, types, and potential anomalies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics are calculated to understand the central tendency and distribution of the data.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Missing data is identified and handled, either by filling in values or removing rows/columns as appropriate.
- **Data Types**: Data types are checked and converted where necessary to ensure compatibility with subsequent analysis steps.

#### 4. Feature Engineering
- **New Features**: The script creates new features by combining or transforming existing columns to enhance the predictive power of the models. Examples include aggregating sales data or normalizing values based on GDP or population.

#### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Linear Regression**: A simple linear regression model was trained to predict global sales based on various features, including regional sales, year, and GDP.
  - **RÂ² Score**: The model yielded a low RÂ² score, indicating that the model explains very little of the variance in the global sales data.
  - **MSE**: The Mean Squared Error was relatively high, pointing to significant errors in the modelâ€™s predictions.

- **Decision Tree Regression**: An attempt to use a decision tree model provided a more flexible approach, but it still underperformed.
  - **RÂ² Score**: Although slightly better than linear regression, the RÂ² score remained unsatisfactory, implying poor predictive accuracy.
  - **MSE**: The decision tree also resulted in a high MSE, reflecting large prediction errors.

- **Neural Network Model**: A deep learning model was implemented using TensorFlow to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
  - **RÂ² Score**: The TensorFlow model also failed to achieve a satisfactory RÂ² score, suggesting that even complex models struggle to capture the underlying patterns.
  - **MSE**: The high MSE confirmed that the model's predictions were still off by a significant margin.

#### Analysis of Findings

The analysis attempted to build predictive models to estimate global video game sales using a variety of features. However, the results were not successful, as indicated by the evaluation metrics:

- **RÂ² Scores**: Across all models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and TensorFlow), the RÂ² scores were low, indicating that the models were not able to adequately explain the variance in the global sales data. This suggests that the chosen features may not be sufficient to predict sales, or that the relationships between these features and global sales are more complex than the models can capture.

- **MSE Values**: The high MSE values across all models further confirmed the poor predictive performance. Large errors in the predictions indicate that the models were not accurate in estimating the global sales figures.

#### Possible Reasons for Poor Model Performance

- **Feature Limitations**: The features used (e.g., regional sales, GDP, year) might not capture the key drivers of global sales, such as marketing strategies, game quality, or consumer behavior.
- **Data Quality**: Issues with data quality, such as missing values or inconsistencies, could have adversely affected the models' ability to learn.
- **Model Complexity**: Even the deep learning model struggled, suggesting that the relationships within the data might require different modeling approaches, additional data collection or more sophisticated feature engineering.

#### Prerequisites

  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `sqlite3`: For database interactions.
  - `sklearn`: For machine learning models.
  - `tensorflow`: For deep learning models.
  - `matplotlib`: For visualizations.

#### Usage

1. **Prepare the Environment**: Ensure that the required libraries are installed, and the SQLite database is correctly placed in the specified path.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script cell by cell if using a Jupyter notebook, or run it as a standalone Python script.

3. **Analyze the Results**: Review the output, particularly the RÂ² and MSE values, to understand the limitations of the models.

#### Conclusion

This script provides a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data, but the predictive models developed were not successful. The findings suggest that further work is needed to improve model performance, potentially through the inclusion of additional features, better data cleaning, or the use of alternative modeling techniques.
